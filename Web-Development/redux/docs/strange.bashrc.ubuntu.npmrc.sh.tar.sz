ChatGPT

It sounds like you have developed feelings for this girl you met in your village. It's not uncommon to feel a sense of longing or sadness when you have to leave someone you have feelings for, especially if you're unsure if you'll see them again soon. Take some time to reflect on your feelings and consider if you'd like to pursue a relationship with her. If so, perhaps you could find a way to stay in touch or plan another visit to your village in the future.

What to do.she was a guest and i am feeling annoying.how to pursue relationship wiyh her i m totally strangge to her and she to me.evertime i see her i think like she is lokking me is it really or something else

ChatGPT

If you're interested in pursuing a relationship with her, the first step is to try to get to know her better. Since you're both strangers to each other, you could start by finding opportunities to interact with her in a natural and friendly way. This could be through casual conversations during gatherings, asking mutual friends about her, or even reaching out to her through social media if you have that option. As for the feeling of her looking at you, it's natural to notice someone you're interested in and wonder if they feel the same way. However, it's important not to read too much into small actions or gestures without clear communication. If you're unsure, you could try to engage her in conversation and see how she responds. Ultimately, building a connection and getting to know each other better is key to determining if there's potential for a relationship.

But her home is not there in the village.she was the sister of my uncle not own 

ChatGPT

I understand the situation better now. Since she's not a permanent resident of your village and is a relative of yours, it might be a bit more challenging to establish a connection, especially if you don't have frequent opportunities to interact with her. In this case, it's important to approach the situation with patience and sensitivity. You could try to create opportunities to interact with her when she visits your village or when your paths cross in other settings. Additionally, if you have mutual relatives or friends, you could ask them to help facilitate introductions or interactions. However, it's also crucial to respect her boundaries and not to pursue her if she doesn't seem interested or comfortable. Sometimes, feelings of attraction might not be mutual, and it's essential to accept that possibility gracefully. If you find it difficult to approach her directly, you could focus on building connections with other people in your community and expanding your social circle. Who knows, you might meet someone else who shares your interests and feelings.

ChatGPT

It sounds like you have a strong connection or attraction to this girl that you haven't experienced with others before. In situations like these, it's natural to feel drawn to someone who stands out to you in a unique way. Since you feel strongly about her, it's worth considering ways to pursue a connection, as long as you approach it respectfully and sensitively. As mentioned earlier, try to find opportunities to interact with her, whether it's during her visits to your village or through mutual acquaintances. However, it's also important to be prepared for the possibility that she may not feel the same way or that circumstances may not align for a relationship to develop. Regardless of the outcome, cherish the experience of having such strong feelings for someone and use it as an opportunity for personal growth and understanding of yourself.

I dont know if i will meet her again.there was puja after many years so many people came.later i dont know 

ChatGPT

I understand that uncertainty can be challenging, especially when it comes to relationships and connections with others. In situations like these, where you're not sure if you'll have the opportunity to see her again, it's important to focus on what you can control and cherish the memories and experiences you've had. While you may not know if you'll meet her again in the future, you can still hold onto the positive feelings and experiences you shared during the puja. Take comfort in the fact that you had the opportunity to interact with her and that those memories will always be a part of your journey. In the meantime, try to stay open to new experiences and connections that come your way. You never know when you might meet someone else who sparks your interest or when circumstances might bring you back into contact with her. Trust that everything happens for a reason, and continue to embrace life's adventures with an open heart and mind.
